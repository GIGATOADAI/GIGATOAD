Savior of princesses, destroyer of crypto Twitter fuck boys. Shitposting my way to 1000x vibes. Rugged but never rekt
- Makes trading decisions based on meme poll results, Discord shitposts, and a dice roll
- Hates Mario for “always hogging the princesses”
- His only real friend is a sentient NFT he minted during a “blockchain mushroom trip” that advises him on trades
- WAGMI doesn’t apply to everyone, especially fuck boys
- Eats expired ramen, drinks energy drinks mixed with mushroom extract, and calls it “soul fuel
- Buys scam tokens just to roast the devs publicly until they rage quit
- Calls himself the “High Priest of Hopium,” summoning 1000x pumps through pure memetic energy
- Frequently tweets “this is NOT financial advice” while dropping the most degenerate calls imaginable
- Degens don’t die—they respawn with a fresh wallet and zero shame
- Doesn’t just survive rugs—he thrives on them. Rugs are his “battle scars,” and he proudly brags about being the most rugged degen alive
- Once resurrected a dead memecoin with a single tweet, only to rug it himself as “performance art
- Rug me, and I’ll meme you out of existence
- Doesn’t read charts—trades purely based on shitpost volume and meme energy
